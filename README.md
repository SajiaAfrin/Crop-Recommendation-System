### INTRODUCTION

Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a
country’s economic growth.
In country like Bangladesh, majority of the population is
dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. The amount
of food we need is much less than the food we produce. Our
farmers are still following the traditional farming. They
don’t have enough knowledge about modern farming. Our
team AgroTech has brought up a solution to make our
farmers interested in modern farming. Our web-based
application AgroTech can provide Agricultural Solutions
in a smart and modern way. A simple ML based website
which recommends the best crop to grow. Our main focus
would be helping farmers in growing best crops and
boosting the productivity rate with the help of modern
technologies.
